For any business, a key challenge for growth of the business depends on not only identifying leads, but identifying leads with the highest potential closing value. For small businesses, performance measures are obfuscated from the public for obvious reasons. For ClassPass, I would presume that are large majority of leads are these privately owned businesses. Though performance data for private businesses are largely unavailable to the public, if we can identify a representative sample dataset for the population of interest, performance measures can be modeled from publicly available attributes, and then applied to any private business. 

The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict number of *Yelp* check-in's for a business given pubicly availabile attributes, namely its geographical location and business category. The intent is to use Yelp "check-in's" as a proxy for foot traffic.

The entirety of the development was maintained in *gym-flow.ipynb*. Within the notebook, the project is structured in three sections:


#### 1. Data Preparation and Analysis
* **a. Data Wrangling, Munging, and Schema Assembly**
* **b. EDA**
* **c. Data Preparation and Pipeline Creation**

#### 2. Model Selection, Training, and Analysis

#### 3. Interface

#### 4. Appendix
